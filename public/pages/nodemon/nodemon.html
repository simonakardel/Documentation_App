    <h1>Using Nodemon in Node.js</h1>
<section >
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Nodemon is a utility that monitors your Node.js application for any changes in the source code and automatically restarts the server when changes are detected. This saves time and increases productivity during development as you don't need to manually restart the server after making changes to the code.

    <h2>Configuration</h2>
    <p>
        You can customize Nodemon's behavior by creating a configuration file called "nodemon.json" in the root directory of your project. Some common configuration options include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>watch:</strong> Specify the directories and files to be watched for changes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>ignore:</strong> Specify the directories and files to be ignored and not trigger a restart.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>ext:</strong> Specify the file extensions to be watched.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>delay:</strong> Specify the delay between the change detection and the server restart.
        </li>
    </ul>
