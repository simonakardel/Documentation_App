      <h1>Functions</h1>
      <p>Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks of the language. They are reusable pieces of code that can be defined once and called multiple times, allowing you to execute a specific task or computation with different inputs.</p>

        <h2>1. Function Declaration</h2>
        <p>A function declaration is one way to define a function. It starts with the function keyword, followed by the function name, a list of parameters enclosed in parentheses, and a block of code enclosed in curly braces.</p>

        <h2>2. Function Expression</h2>
        <p>A function expression is another way to define a function. In a function expression, a function is assigned to a variable. The function can be anonymous (without a name) or named.</p>

        <h2>3. Arrow Functions</h2>
        <p>Arrow functions are a more concise way to define functions, introduced in ES6. They use the "fat arrow" syntax (=>) and do not require the function keyword. Arrow functions also have lexical this binding, which means that they inherit the this value from their enclosing scope, making them suitable for use in certain scenarios, such as callbacks.</p>

        <h2>4. Higher Order Functions</h2>
        <p>In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects, which means that they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as values from other functions. A higher-order function is a function that either takes one or more functions as arguments or returns a function as its result.</p>

        <h2>5. Callback Functions</h2>
        <p>Callback functions are functions passed as arguments to other functions, which are then executed at a later point in time. Callbacks are used in asynchronous operations, event handling, and higher-order functions.</p>
