    <h2>1. Introduction to XSS</h2>
    <p>
        Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious
        scripts into web pages viewed by other users. XSS attacks occur when an application includes untrusted data on a
        web page without proper validation or escaping, allowing the attacker to execute scripts in the context of the
        user's browser. These scripts can be used to steal sensitive information, perform actions on behalf of the user,
        or deface web content.
    </p>
    <p>
        In a backend-driven XSS attack, the attacker typically submits crafted input containing malicious scripts
        through a form, URL parameter, or API call. The server processes this input and stores it in a database or
        another storage medium. When other users access the web page where the tainted data is displayed, their browsers
        execute the injected scripts.

    <h2>2. How to avoid XSS</h2>
    <p>The escape-html package is a simple utility for escaping HTML special characters in strings. By using this
        package, you can prevent HTML injection and mitigate the risk of XSS attacks. To install escape-html package in
        your Node.js application run the following command:</p>
    <img src="/assets/images/escape.svg" class="snippet">
    <p>Use the escapeHtml() function to escape any string that contains user-generated content before rendering it in
        your HTML.</p>
    <p>By using the escape-html package, you can ensure that any potentially harmful characters in user-generated
        content are escaped before being rendered in your HTML, significantly reducing the risk of XSS attacks. Remember
        to escape user-generated content wherever it's included in your HTML, such as in element attributes, to provide
        comprehensive protection against XSS.</p>
