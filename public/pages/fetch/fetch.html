<h1>Fetching Data in Javascript</h1>

    <h2>Introduction to Fetch</h2>
    <p>
        The Fetch API is a modern, powerful, and flexible API for fetching resources in JavaScript. It is a built-in
        feature of modern web browsers and is designed to replace XMLHttpRequest. The Fetch API is promise-based and
        follows the ES6 standard.

    <h2>Basic Syntax</h2>
    <p>
        To use the Fetch API, call the global fetch() function with the resource URL as its argument:

    <h2>Handling Responses</h2>
    <p>
        The fetch() function returns a promise that resolves to a Response object. To handle the response, use the
        .then() method followed by another promise to parse the response data, and another .then() to access the parsed
        data:
    </p>

        In the example above, the response is parsed as JSON. You can use other parsing methods, e.g. .text().

    <h2>Using Fetch with async/await</h2>
    <p>
        You can use the Fetch API with the ES6 async/await syntax to write cleaner and more readable code:

    <h2>Fetch with Request Options</h2>
    <p>
        You can provide an optional second argument to the fetch() function to specify request options, such as method,
        headers, and body:
